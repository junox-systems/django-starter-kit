"""App shell navigation.

The sidebar is a persistent Svelte island (Sidebar.svelte) that survives Turbo
navigations, so it cannot re-render from server HTML per page. It therefore
receives its links once as props and tracks the active item client-side.

URLs are resolved here rather than hardcoded in JS. Icon names are keys into a
map inside Sidebar.svelte — never pass raw SVG markup through JSON.
